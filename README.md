# traefik Proxy Manager

⚠ **Warning** This project is in heavy development! ⚠

## Project Goal
This project was heavily inspired by [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager).
Friends of mine were using it however my friends expressed several feature requests that they missed.  
Since most infrastructure now runs on Docker and Nginx Proxy manager unfortunately doesn't live natively in containers, I thought it would be very fitting to write an interface for [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/).

## Features
- 🌌 Modern infrastructure
- 🏃 Fast thanks to the nature of Go
- 💡 Easy to switch from Nginx Proxy Manager
- 🔐 Free Let's Encrypt certificates
- 🐳 Infrastructures lives natively in docker

## Quick Setup
